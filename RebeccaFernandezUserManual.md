## Ryan Samuelson User Manual

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

I have ADD, which was misdiagnosed for most of my life and made school very difficult. I learned a lot about grit fighting through an engineering degree without being able to get the help I needed to succeed. I don't believe in GPAs because of this. 

My wife and my dog are the two most important things in my life. 

Most of my career experience has been with startups, which has given me little patience for bureaucracy (which there wasn't much of) or office politics (which there was a lot of).

### What drives you nuts?

* Unnecessary meetings and drive-by requests
* Fire drills caused by a lack of thinking strategically and analytically from the beginning, or Fire Drills caused by a lack of including analytics early enough in your ideation/design process
* “We do it this way because we’ve always done it this way”
* When we receive data requests like “just need data points to insert into my doc”. The assumption that the data is going to fit the doc's hypothesis is backwards. I want our customers using data to inform their hypothesis and docs before they even start writing instead of vice versa.
* When people IM me and just say “Hi” or “Hi Rebecca” (more info: http://www.nohello.com/)

### What are your quirks?

I like to work weird hours. I’m more of a night owl than a morning person so sometimes it’s easiest for me to crank something out until 3am vs get up at 6am and keep working on it. I’m always working on becoming a morning person. I don't expect anyone to try and match someone's schedule, work when is most productive to you, just make sure your stakeholders feel supported.

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

* Thorough and thought-out requirements! Come to office hours, let's map it out. Don't hide extra steps to save me work...We should be able to do it faster!
* Cancelling meetings, having an agenda for a meeting
* I love a well-formmatted email
* Thinking about how data should help form their hypothesis vs asking our team to supply data to fit their hypothesis
* Taking a little longer to do something the right way because it requires you to learn something new instead getting it done quickly in a way that someone will have to redo it eventually

### What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?

I really value people who are self-starters, like to learn new things, and those who tend to think outside of the box. I appreciate people who ask “why” and say “no, but...” instead of “no.” I'm also a big fan of people who are inclusive and understand the importance of collaboration.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

My “turnover” cost is higher than I wish it was (see question 1). I may ask you to wait or communicate information to me in a specific way – it’s not that I don’t think it’s a priority, I just need to turn my brain off of whatever I’m currently working on or I won't absorb the information.

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?

* If you're explaining a process or system, visual is best... I love whiteboards.
* If you need something from me or my team: SIM
* If you need an answer within 24 hours: Chime or text, but I prefer Chime
* Otherwise: Email

In terms of personal values around communication, I value transparency and situational awareness above all else.

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?

A mentor of mine once said, “Show me the data!” and I love that. Either show me the data, or show me that you're eager to use data to form your hypothesis. Show me that you're fighting for your customer and/or what's right for the business.

This includes showing how much time your request would save you and/or how it would impact your goals.

### How do you like to give/get feedback?

I try to be flexible with how you like to receive feedback, if I have that information. If I don’t, or they’re not on my team, I’ll usually organize my thoughts in an email and offer to follow up with a meeting, if necessary. I'm a big believer in radical candor.

I'm not too picky on the delivery. It’s important for me to be solutions-based, so I may jump right to solutions when I receive feedback. It doesn’t mean I don’t hear you or appreciate your feedback, it generally means that I agree and want to work to make sure it doesn’t happen again. 

### How do you like to learn?

I'm a visual learner, I almost always have a whiteboard marker on me. I prefer to learn new skills by doing/building. Small projects or on-the-job training has always been the best for me. I also like learning new skills by solving small problems: I taught myself python by looking at my everyday processes and seeing what I could automate.

### What do you want to learn?

I want to continue learning more advanced python and machine learning strategies. I also want to keep learning about how to be a better manager of a technical team, specifically how can I do my best to evangelize the strategic and impactful work they're doing.

### What's your idea of a fun team event?

I like anything that doesn't require staring at each other and making small talk. I used to be a high ropes course instructor and a football coach, so I tend to like doing more physical activity type things with people. Really any sport, or anything on a boat, or a fun class picking up a random skill. I'm not a huge karaoke fan but Chuck's obsessed (I think he's maybe famous in some parts of the world?) and it is pretty entertaining.
